            <p> Hubs are deigned to be a direct replacement for the cast alloy hubs found on BMW r100s
                and
                R80s. These
                hubs are designed to allow monolever BMWs to be built up as either offroad g/s type bikes or for
                cafe
                racers
                to achieve the classic look. </p>
            <p>CNC machined from billet aluminium with a cast iron brake surface, these
                hubs
                allow the front and back wheels to run in line with the centre of the bike. This aspect of the hub
                design is
                crucial if you are touring or road racing and you want your bike to handle and brake well.</p>
            <p>Some hubs
                converted from other BMWs have to have their spokes bent into shape to fit a conventional rim which
                results
                ultimatley in the rim cracking between the spoke holes. This may be OK for show bikes but will not
                do if
                the
                bikes are intended to be used. There is no machining needed to your standard components on the bike
                .
            </p>
            <p>Standard calipers and discs are used on the front. Just unbolt the discs from your cast wheel and
                bolt
                them
                to your AMW hub. You can retain your stock through bolts or use the AMW button headed bolts as the
                AMW
                hub
                holes are threaded ready for their installation.</p>
            <p>The rear hubs just bolt into place using the standard
                wheel
                bolts or the 55mm long bolts from the K series bikes. The rear hub retains the 40 hole set up or 36
                hole
                hubs can be ordered. Standard 80 g/s rims can be used.</p>
